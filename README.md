# checknlock
Checks if the current active window is of twitch or youtube and locks the screen if video has not been played for more than 2 minutes.  
  
Uses xflock4 to lock screen. (I use xfce4 based distro)  
Checks if media active using pulse audio specific code.  
Uses xprop to get current active window name.
